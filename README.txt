EchoFarm - Android (Java) starter project
----------------------------------------
What this is:
- A minimal Android Studio project implementing a simple farming grid.
- Tap a tile to plant (cost 1 coin). Wait ~5 seconds for crop to mature. Tap a mature crop to harvest (+2 coins).
- ShopActivity offers a debug button to add coins for testing.

How to build:
1. Open Android Studio.
2. Import this folder as an existing project.
3. Let Android Studio sync Gradle and install required SDK components.
4. Run on an emulator or connected Android device. You'll get an APK you can install.

Notes:
- This is a small starter game. You should replace visuals with proper graphics (drawables or canvas sprites),
  add persistence for farm state, polish UI, integrate IAP and ads, add sound effects, and optimize for performance.
- The project uses a simple game loop on a SurfaceView. It's intentionally minimal to be easy to extend.


Upgrades applied:
- Persistent farm state saved as JSON in SharedPreferences.
- Main UI layout with coins display, Shop and Settings buttons.
- Shop uses an IAP stub for simulated purchases and a debug buy button.
- Settings activity for toggling sound (placeholder).
- AdManager and IAP stubs added for future SDK integration.
- Drawable XMLs added for simple UI styling.

How to build and test:
1. Open Android Studio, Import the project folder.
2. Sync Gradle. If any manifest or gradle plugin versions prompt updates, accept recommended updates.
3. Run on device/emulator. Use Shop -> Buy 10 coins to test purchases.

Enjoy!
Additional upgrades applied (Do EVERYTHING):
- AudioManager added (SoundPool + MediaPlayer) and silent placeholder sounds included in assets/sounds.
- BillingManager skeleton added (Google Play Billing client integration points).
- AdManager skeleton added (AdMob integration points).
- Vector drawable assets for crop/farmer and adaptive launcher icon created.
- ProGuard rules placeholder added.
- App build.gradle updated with recommended dependencies for billing, ads, and firebase analytics.
- Full farm persistence, UI, settings, shop flows already implemented earlier.

Important notes for finalization and publishing:
1. Replace placeholder Ad Unit IDs and set up AdMob account; remove stubs and call AdManager.init in MainActivity on startup.
2. Implement real Billing flow: map product IDs, handle acknowledgements, and securely validate purchases when possible.
3. Add real audio files (place raw .wav/.ogg in assets/sounds or res/raw) and call AudioManager.init in MainActivity.onCreate.
4. Create a signing keystore and configure release signing in Android Studio: Build -> Generate Signed Bundle/APK.
5. For Play Store, create a Play Console account, prepare store listing (privacy policy, icons, screenshots), and upload an AAB.
6. If you want cloud save or analytics, set up Firebase project and add google-services.json (not included here).

Security & compliance reminders:
- Add privacy policy and disclose use of Ads/IAP. Handle GDPR/consent if targeting EU users.
- Test billing flows with Google Play test accounts before publishing.
- Remove debug/test purchase buttons before release build.

If you want, I will now:
- Generate placeholder PNG screenshots in /art/screenshots for Play Store listing.
- Add proguard and Gradle signing template (keystore path placeholders).
- Attempt to integrate a minimal Firebase config placeholder (note: requires real credentials).
- Create a ready-to-upload AAB build script (Gradle command) you can run locally.
